# vbcc-M68K toolchain for Windows

Build the Release configuration for the x86 platform from inside Visual Studio, or run the following from the VS CLI:<br>
```msbuild vbcc.sln /m /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=x86```

The MSVS solution was made with Visual Studio Community 2015, but will probably build correctly with earlier versions.
